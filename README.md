# Multitasking Simulation in Python üöÄ  

This repository contains Python implementations and reports for a multitasking simulation case study. The project demonstrates the principles of threading, concurrency, and parallelism through a real-world scenario involving a morning routine. It is designed to highlight the efficiency and performance improvements achieved by applying multitasking techniques.

## üìã Project Overview  

The project consists of two main tasks:  

###  Multitasking in Real-World Applications  
In this part analyzing how multitasking concepts are applied in real-world web servers to optimize performance and efficiency. This task covers:  
- Threading  
- Concurrency  
- Parallelism  
- Practical implications of multitasking in web servers  

###  Python Simulation of a Morning Routine  
This part simulates a morning routine using Python to showcase different multitasking concepts:  
1. **Sequential Execution**: Executes tasks one after another.  
2. **Parallel Execution with Downtime Optimization**: Utilizes idle time during one task to initiate another.  
3. **Concurrent Execution Using Multithreading**: Implements true multitasking with Python's `threading` module.

## üìà Insights

- Sequential Execution: Tasks execute one after another; less efficient.
- Parallel Execution: Utilizes idle time for better task optimization.
- Multithreading: Achieves true multitasking with concurrent execution.
